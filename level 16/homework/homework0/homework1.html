        <p1><b>The history of biotechnology begins with zymotechnology,
            <br>which commenced with a focus on brewing techniques for beer.</b>
            <br>By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle
            <br>larger industrial issues, and the potential of industrial
            <br>fermentation gave rise to biotechnology.</p1>

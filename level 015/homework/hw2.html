    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: red; background-color: black; text-align: center;">Volcanism of the Mount Edziza volcanic <br>complex in British Columbia, Canada, spans more than 7 million years. The first magmatic cycle took place between 7.5 and 6 <br>million years ago and is represented by the Raspberry, Little Iskut and Armadillo geological formations. Volcanism has taken <br>place during five cycles of magmatic activity, each producing less volcanic material than the previous one. During these <br>cycles volcanism has created several types of volcanoes, including cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, subglacial volcanoes, shield <br>volcanoes and lava domes. The roughly 1,000-square-kilometre (400-square-mile) volcanic plateau of the MEVC originated from  <br>the successive eruptions of highly mobile lava flows. Several types of volcanic rocks were deposited by multiple eruptions of <br>the MEVC. At least 10 distinct flows of obsidian were produced by volcanism of the MEVC, some of which were exploited by <br>indigenous peoples in prehistoric times to make tools and weapons.

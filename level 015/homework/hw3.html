    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: red; background-color: black; text-align: center;">The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə lisə/ MOH-nə LEE-sə; Italian: la Gioconda [la dʒokonda] or Monna Lisa [mɔnna liza]; French: la <br>Joconde [la ʒɔkɔ̃d]) is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal <br>masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,[4][5] it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written <br>about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world."[6] The painting's novel qualities include the <br>subject's enigmatic expression,[7] monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric <br>illusionism.[8]<br><br>

        The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo.[9] It is painted in oil on <br>a white poplar panel.[10] Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family.[11] It was believed to have been <br>painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of <br>France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has <br>normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.[12]<br><br>
        
        The painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to <br>Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented <br>publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two <br>early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song "Mona Lisa" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of <br>the most successful songs of the 1950s.[13]<br><br>
        
        The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known <br>painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962,[14] equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023.[15]<br></p>

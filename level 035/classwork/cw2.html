    to create a single HTML element; we can define the inline CSS on the style attribute.</p><br><br>

    the layout of a single HTML web page and change the styles of a web page within HTML code.</p><br><br>

    It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always<br>
    saved with the . css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page</p>

        <h2>What Dangers Could Earth Face?</h2>
        <p>Our planet faces a variety of threats, many of which are monitored by NASA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asteroid Impacts:</strong> NASA monitors Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that could potentially collide with Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Flares:</strong> Powerful solar storms could damage Earth's communications, power grids, and satellites.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changes in Earth's climate could lead to rising sea levels, extreme weather, and disruptions to ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Pandemics:</strong> The risk of disease outbreaks, amplified by global connectivity, remains a serious threat to humanity.</li>
            <li><strong>Supervolcanic Eruptions:</strong> Massive volcanic events could cause widespread devastation and impact the global climate.</li>
        </ul>
